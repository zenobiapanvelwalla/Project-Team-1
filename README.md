Abstract
Description:
After marketing a franchise system successfully, a good franchisor will provide meaningful support and guidance to the new franchise partners on a consistent basis. The value of a franchise model should add up to much more than just the collection of a franchise fee. There should be substantial value 6 months, 2 years and even 10 years into the franchise relationship. Like any marketing or sales model, it is much more efficient and profitable for a franchisor to retain happy, profitable franchisees than to continue going out and looking for new ones.
Methodology:
A Web application can be developed using Javascript, node js or ibm-worklight . The application which has various features like creating a stand-alone web page for marketing, a section to manage royalties , etc. There will be users with different roles in the system as admin(franchisor) , normal user(franchisee).
